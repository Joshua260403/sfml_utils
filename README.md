# sfml_utils

These widgets are created for [Nature Zen](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/djog_unos_2018).
The code is mostly made by me, although there might be some little changes team octane members made.

NOTE: The code might contain references, functions, variables and classes from Nature Zen that aren't in here.

NOTE: Some of the code in this repository may be work in progress, this will likely be marked with TODO but that is not guaranteed.
