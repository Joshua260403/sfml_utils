# sfml_utils

These widgets are created for [Nature Zen](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/djog_unos_2018).
The code is mostly made by me, although there might be some little changes team octane members made.

Feel free to contact me in any way if there is an issue with the code.

NOTE: The code might contain references, functions, variables and classes from Nature Zen that aren't in here.

NOTE: Some of the code in this repository may be work in progress, this will likely be marked with TODO but that is not guaranteed.

## Licensing

You are free to use the code in this repository in your project as long as your project is open source (see: [LICENSE](LICENSE)).
