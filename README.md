These widgets are created for [Nature Zen](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/djog_unos_2018).
The code is mostly made by me, although there might be some little changes team octane members made.

The code might contain references, functions, variables and classes from Nature Zen that aren't in here.

You are free to use the code in this repository in your project as long as your project is open source (see: [LICENSE](LICENSE)).
